### Truss Stiffness Model


This models truss elements as a pair of points connected by a straight line. Solving this involves the following steps:

1. Calculate the local stiffness matrix for each truss element.
2. Assemble the global stiffness matrix.
3. Apply boundary conditions.
4. Solve linear system relating nodal displacements to nodal forces.
5. Get stresses and strains
6. Calculate constitutive matrix
